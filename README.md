# syntheticInfostealers
This software creates reasonable facsimiles of the typical files included in an "infostealer log" purchase. Currently covers the following infostealer families:
* Atomic
* Lumma
* Redline
* Stealc
* Vidar

### Personas.csv
The personas.csv file contains the information needed to create the synthetic logs. Users should edit this file as needed to add/delete rows. Columns should remain the same since those are used by the software to make a realistic log file.

The first column in the spreadsheet, "Infection," indicates which stealer we want to infect this person.

All of the data in the sample spreadsheet is fake, including fake names, fake domains and emails, etc.
