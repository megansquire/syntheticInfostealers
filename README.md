# syntheticInfostealers
Code to create reasonable facsimiles of the typical files included in an "infostealer log" purchase. Given a spreadsheet of data about an infected "persona", and an indicator of which infostealer infected that persona, this software creates a set of infostealer logs that resemble that type of infection.
